# college_virtual_tour_final_year_project
We are all aware that virtual reality is a new emerging
technology in the modern era. Virtual reality has enormous
potential across many industries like Education, Hospitality,
Gaming, Army, Tourism, etc. It is the medium of creating our own
world, our own customized reality. In this paper, we discussed the
extended reality concepts to make the virtual tour of the college
campus with real voice assistant service that based on IoT concept.
It is the key to experiencing, feeling and touching the college
premises, using VR Technology. With this project any of guests
want to visit the college premises, He/She can do virtually with our
assistant service. In hectic schedules, colleges are facing
difficulties during visiting the college to the parents because all
faculty members have their other work to do. With this problem,
the virtual tour is a solution. So we make the virtual tour with
unique voice assistant facility on the concept of IoT technology
which will provide the information regarding the place where the
visitor will enter for visit by the help of VR Headset.
